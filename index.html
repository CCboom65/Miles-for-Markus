                        <h2>Markus story</h2>
                        <p class="section-one"> Mark Allison, Markus as we called him, was born in Ottawa, but once he came west, he never looked back. And eventually settled in Prince Rupert, where he met and married, and soon became a father to Noah. And making a long story short, well Markus was the GOAT, as he was definately one of a kind. He enjoyed laughing, working hard to provide for his family and was exceptionally proud of his son Noah. They both share the passion of music and you can ask Noah anything about the Beatles, he will know the answer. Markus was passionate about his guitar playing and eventually wrote his own song, called one goood leg. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/markallisonmusic/about/" target="_blank">Link to Markus music</a>
                            <p class="section-one">Markus sadly got cancer in the beginning of 2020, and his journey was like no other. Along the way, he sadly lost his bladder, and his left leg above the knee. But that didnt darken his spirits, he took everything in stride and showed us what strength, courage and resiliency is truly all about. He was definately a beast, when it came to fighting cancer. And when the battle seemed endless, thats when our son turned to running as a way to leave the hospital and its heartache behind. And this was truly the birth of Healing through endurance began.</p>

                        <p>In June of 2023, when my husbands health took a turn for the worse. And my son Noah began to run for his healing journey, it helped him be free of his mind. When he ran, it allowed his mind to be free, of the harsh realities of his fathers cancer journey. And really, miles for Markus well it all started with 144 km for Markus, where Noah decided he was going to run from Prince Rupert to Terrace and raise money for cancer research.<a href="https://fundraisemyway.cancer.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.search&contextualSearch=1&filter=participant&searchTerm=noah+allison" target="_blank">Link to Canadian Cancer Society fundraising page</a>
