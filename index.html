                    <p> Miles for Markus began in the summer of 2023, when my husbands health took a turn for the worse. And my son began to run for his healing journey, it helped him be free of his mind. It all started with 144 km for Markus, where Noah decided he was going to run 144 km, from Prince Rupert to Terrace and raise money for cancer research.</p>
